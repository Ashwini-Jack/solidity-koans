This is an intermediate series for learning Solidity and smart contract development. You will explore technicalities from syntax edgecases, to assembly in the EVM, to smart contract coding conventions, all through test driven development.

## Learning Path
---
### Standard data types
1. [Asserts](./test/Test_Assert_1.sol)
2. [Numbers](./test/Test_Numbers_2.sol)
3. [Bytes](./test/Test_Bits_Bytes_3.sol)
4. [Arrays](./test/Test_Arrays_4.sol)
5. [Mappings](./test/Test_Mappings_5.sol)
6. [Structs](./test/Test_Structs_6.sol)
7. [Storage](./test/Test_Storage_7.sol)

### Function types (in progress)
- variable modifers: public private
- Visbility modifiers: public, private, external, etc.
- Getter modifiers: view, pure, constant

### Transactions details (in progress)
- address & how its computed
- data types: sender, value, gas, this
- async return values

### Javascript client (in progress)
- events
- error handling: require, asserts
- free getter functions
- constructing send / call fns

### Design patterns (in progress)
- interfaces
- libraries, ERC libs
- factory patterns

### Security (in progress)
- ownership
- overflow, underflow
- re-entry
- tx.origin
- delegatecall: scope
- storage hacks

### Solidity Assembly (in progress)
- bytecode & opcodes

## Directions
---
### How to Setup
* Clone the repo: 
```git clone https://github.com/nczhu/solidity-koans.git```
* Install dependencies: 
```
npm install -g truffle ganache-cli
```
* Start Ganache: `ganache-cli`
* In a new tab, check out the `/test` directory, where each test represents a koan. To get started with the easiest (and first) Koan, run:
`truffle test ./test/Test_assert_1.sol`

### How to Tackle Each Koan
 1. Each test is initially incomplete, e.g.: 
 ```
 function test_should_return_true() public {
    Assert.isTrue(__, "should return true");
 }
 ```
 2. Run each level with: `truffle test ./test/Test_FILENAME`
 Tests will fail with error messages, e.g.:
 ```
 2) Test_Assert_1
    test_should_return_true::
    Error: should return true
 ```
 3. In your editor, replace `__` with the correct values or code, e.g.: 
 ```
 function test_should_return_true() public {
    Assert.isTrue(true, "should return true");
 }
 ```
 4. To pass each level, make sure:
   * All tests are passing
   * All compiler warnings and errors are fixed

* Hint: Use [Remix IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org) to test potential solutions

## Troubleshooting
---
- `Member "..." not unique after argument-dependent lookup in type(library Assert)`. *Solution*: try typecasting your answer to solve compiler issues.

## Contributing
---
